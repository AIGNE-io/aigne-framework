## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and npm installed on your machine
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) used to interact with OpenAI API
- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io) [Optional] if you want to run the example from source code

## Try without Installation

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY # setup your OpenAI API key

npx -y @aigne/example-workflow-sequential # run the example
```

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIGNE-io/aigne-framework
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd aigne-framework/examples/workflow-sequential

pnpm install
```

### Setup Environment Variables

Setup your OpenAI API key in the `.env.local` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="" # setup your OpenAI API key here
```

### Run the Example

```bash
pnpm start
```

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to build a sequential workflow:

```typescript
import assert from "node:assert";
import { AIAgent, OpenAIChatModel, ExecutionEngine, sequential } from "@aigne/core";

const { OPENAI_API_KEY } = process.env;
assert(OPENAI_API_KEY, "Please set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable");

const model = new OpenAIChatModel({
  apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const conceptExtractor = AIAgent.from({
  instructions: `\
You are a marketing analyst. Give a product description, identity:
- Key features
- Target audience
- Unique selling points

Product description:
{{product}}`,
  outputKey: "concept",
});

const writer = AIAgent.from({
  instructions: `\
You are a marketing copywriter. Given a block of text describing features, audience, and USPs,
compose a compelling marketing copy (like a newsletter section) that highlights these points.
Output should be short (around 150 words), output just the copy as a single text block.

Product description:
{{product}}

Below is the info about the product:
{{concept}}`,
  outputKey: "draft",
});

const formatProof = AIAgent.from({
  instructions: `\
You are an editor. Given the draft copy, correct grammar, improve clarity, ensure consistent tone,
give format and make it polished. Output the final improved copy as a single text block.

Product description:
{{product}}

Below is the info about the product:
{{concept}}

Draft copy:
{{draft}}`,
  outputKey: "content",
});

const engine = new ExecutionEngine({ model });

const result = await engine.call(sequential(conceptExtractor, writer, formatProof), {
  product: "AIGNE is a No-code Generative AI Apps Engine",
});

console.log(result);

// Output:
// {
//   concept: "**Product Description: AIGNE - No-code Generative AI Apps Engine**\n\nAIGNE is a cutting-edge No-code Generative AI Apps Engine designed to empower users to seamlessly create ...",
//   draft: "Unlock the power of creation with AIGNE, the revolutionary No-code Generative AI Apps Engine! Whether you're a small business looking to streamline operations, an entrepreneur ...",
//   content: "Unlock the power of creation with AIGNE, the revolutionary No-Code Generative AI Apps Engine! Whether you are a small business aiming to streamline operations, an entrepreneur ...",
// }
```
