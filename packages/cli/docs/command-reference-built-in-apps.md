# Built-in Apps

Built-in applications are pre-packaged AIGNE projects designed for specialized tasks. They can be invoked directly from the CLI without requiring a local `aigne.yaml` file. The CLI automatically downloads, caches, and manages these applications from the npm registry, making powerful, agent-driven tools readily accessible.

## Available Apps

Currently, the following built-in application is available:

| Command     | Aliases           | Description                                             |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `doc-smith` | `docsmith`, `doc` | Generate and maintain project docs â€” powered by agents. |

## Usage

To use a built-in app, you follow the pattern `aigne [app-name] [subcommand] [options]`. Each app functions as a self-contained AIGNE project, exposing its defined agents as subcommands and including standard commands for management.

### App-Specific Agents

The core functionality of an app is provided through its agents, which are exposed as subcommands. To see a list of available agents and their options, run the app command with the `--help` flag.

```bash
# Get help and see available agents for doc-smith
aigne doc-smith --help
```

Many apps define a default agent that runs when no subcommand is specified. You can run this agent using the app's name or any of its aliases.

```bash
# Run doc-smith
aigne doc-smith generate

# You can also use an alias
aigne doc generate
```

### Common Management Commands

Built-in apps also come with standard subcommands for updates and serving.

#### `upgrade`

This command checks for and installs the latest version of the application from the npm registry.

```bash
aigne doc-smith upgrade
```

#### `serve-mcp`

This command exposes the app's agents through a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, allowing integration with other systems. For more details, see the [`aigne serve-mcp`](./command-reference-serve-mcp.md) command reference.

```bash
# Serve the doc-smith agents on the default host and port
aigne doc-smith serve-mcp
```

## Execution and Caching Flow

When you run a built-in app for the first time, the CLI downloads it from the npm registry (e.g., `@aigne/doc-smith`) and caches it locally in `~/.aigne/registry.npmjs.org/`. Subsequent runs use the cached version. The cache is checked for updates once every 24 hours.

```mermaid

    A["User runs 'aigne doc'"] --> B{"Is app cached and recent (< 24h)?"};
    B -- "Yes" --> E["Load app from local cache"];
    B -- "No" --> C["Fetch '@aigne/doc-smith' from npm registry"];
    C --> D["Download, extract, and install dependencies"];
    D --> E;
    E --> F["Execute specified 'doc' command"];
```

This process ensures that you are always using a functional and up-to-date version of the application with minimal overhead.
