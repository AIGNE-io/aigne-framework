### Summary of Objects
- **Total Objects**: 7

If you need further details or any specific operations on these objects, feel free to ask!

It appears that the file path for writing the object needs to start with a leading slash `/`. I will update the file path to `/test.txt` and attempt to write the content again. 

Let's proceed with that adjustment.The file **test.txt** has been successfully created in the root directory with the following content:

```
Hello from MCP test - 2025-07-10T14:52:40.935Z
```

### File Details
- **Key**: `/test.txt`
- **Size**: 46 bytes
- **Hash**: `8f22442055d7fdf9aca13341ad3883f970aa52c1593e4cf955e1cb2c36692433`
