This is a demonstration of using [AIGNE Framework](https://github.com/AIGNE-io/aigne-framework) to build an orchestrator workflow. The example now supports both one-shot and interactive chat modes, along with customizable model settings and pipeline input/output.

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (>=20.0) and npm installed on your machine
* An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for interacting with OpenAI's services
* Optional dependencies (if running the example from source code):
  * [Bun](https://bun.sh) for running unit tests & examples
  * [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io) for package management

## Quick Start (No Installation Required)

### Run the Example

```bash
# Run in one-shot mode (default)
npx -y @aigne/example-workflow-orchestrator

# Run in interactive chat mode
npx -y @aigne/example-workflow-orchestrator --chat

# Use pipeline input
echo "Research ArcBlock and compile a report about their products and architecture" | npx -y @aigne/example-workflow-orchestrator
```

### Connect to an AI Model

As an example, running `npx -y @aigne/example-afs-system-fs --path . --input "What files are in the current directory?"` requires an AI model. If this is your first run, you need to connect one.

![run example](./run-example.png)

- Connect via the official AIGNE Hub

Choose the first option and your browser will open the official AIGNE Hub page. Follow the prompts to complete the connection. If you're a new user, the system automatically grants 400,000 tokens for you to use.

![connect to official aigne hub](../images/connect-to-aigne-hub.png)

- Connect via a self-hosted AIGNE Hub

Choose the second option, enter the URL of your self-hosted AIGNE Hub, and follow the prompts to complete the connection. If you need to set up a self-hosted AIGNE Hub, visit the App Store to install and deploy it: [Blocklet Store](https://store.blocklet.dev/blocklets/z8ia3xzq2tMq8CRHfaXj1BTYJyYnEcHbqP8cJ?utm_source=www.arcblock.io&utm_medium=blog_link&utm_campaign=default&utm_content=store.blocklet.dev#:~:text=%F0%9F%9A%80%20Get%20Started%20in%20Minutes).

![connect to self hosted aigne hub](../images/connect-to-self-hosted-aigne-hub.png)

- Connect via a third-party model provider

Using OpenAI as an example, you can configure the provider's API key via environment variables. After configuration, run the example again:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="" # Set your OpenAI API key here
```
For more details on third-party model configuration (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google Gemini), see [.env.local.example](./.env.local.example).

After configuration, run the example again.

### Debugging

The `aigne observe` command starts a local web server to monitor and analyze agent execution data. It provides a user-friendly interface to inspect traces, view detailed call information, and understand your agent’s behavior during runtime. This tool is essential for debugging, performance tuning, and gaining insight into how your agent processes information and interacts with tools and models.

Start the observation server.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIGNE-io/aigne-framework
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd aigne-framework/examples/workflow-orchestrator

pnpm install
```

### Run the Example

```bash
pnpm start # Run in one-shot mode (default)

# Run in interactive chat mode
pnpm start -- --chat

# Use pipeline input
echo "Research ArcBlock and compile a report about their products and architecture" | pnpm start
```

### Run Options

The example supports the following command-line parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `--chat` | Run in interactive chat mode | Disabled (one-shot mode) |
| `--model <provider[:model]>` | AI model to use in format 'provider\[:model]' where model is optional. Examples: 'openai' or 'openai:gpt-4o-mini' | openai |
| `--temperature <value>` | Temperature for model generation | Provider default |
| `--top-p <value>` | Top-p sampling value | Provider default |
| `--presence-penalty <value>` | Presence penalty value | Provider default |
| `--frequency-penalty <value>` | Frequency penalty value | Provider default |
| `--log-level <level>` | Set logging level (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE) | INFO |
| `--input`, `-i <input>` | Specify input directly | None |

#### Examples

```bash
# Run in chat mode (interactive)
pnpm start -- --chat

# Set logging level
pnpm start -- --log-level DEBUG

# Use pipeline input
echo "Research ArcBlock and compile a report about their products and architecture" | pnpm start
```

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to build a orchestrator workflow:

Here is the generated report for this example: [arcblock-deep-research.md](./generated-report-arcblock.md)

```typescript
import { OrchestratorAgent } from "@aigne/agent-library/orchestrator/index.js";
import { AIAgent, AIGNE, MCPAgent } from "@aigne/core";
import { OpenAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/openai-chat-model.js";

const { OPENAI_API_KEY } = process.env;

const model = new OpenAIChatModel({
  apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY,
  modelOptions: {
    parallelToolCalls: false, // puppeteer can only run one task at a time
  },
});

const puppeteer = await MCPAgent.from({
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"],
  env: process.env as Record<string, string>,
});

const filesystem = await MCPAgent.from({
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", import.meta.dir],
});

const finder = AIAgent.from({
  name: "finder",
  description: "Find the closest match to a user's request",
  instructions: `You are an agent that can find information on the web.
You are tasked with finding the closest match to the user's request.
You can use puppeteer to scrape the web for information.
You can also use the filesystem to save the information you find.

Rules:
- do not use screenshot of puppeteer
- use document.body.innerText to get the text content of a page
- if you want a url to some page, you should get all link and it's title of current(home) page,
then you can use the title to search the url of the page you want to visit.
  `,
  skills: [puppeteer, filesystem],
});

const writer = AIAgent.from({
  name: "writer",
  description: "Write to the filesystem",
  instructions: `You are an agent that can write to the filesystem.
  You are tasked with taking the user's input, addressing it, and
  writing the result to disk in the appropriate location.`,
  skills: [filesystem],
});

const agent = OrchestratorAgent.from({
  skills: [finder, writer],
  maxIterations: 3,
  tasksConcurrency: 1, // puppeteer can only run one task at a time
});

const aigne = new AIGNE({ model });

const result = await aigne.invoke(
  agent,
  `\
Conduct an in-depth research on ArcBlock using only the official website\
(avoid search engines or third-party sources) and compile a detailed report saved as arcblock.md. \
The report should include comprehensive insights into the company's products \
(with detailed research findings and links), technical architecture, and future plans.`,
);
console.log(result);
// Output:
// {
//   $message: "The objective of conducting in-depth research on ArcBlock using only the official website has been successfully completed...",
// }
```
