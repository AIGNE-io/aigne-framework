# AIGNE Framework Overview

AIGNE Framework is a comprehensive toolkit for building AI-powered applications, providing developers with a flexible and powerful foundation for creating sophisticated AI agent systems. This framework simplifies the integration of multiple AI models, agent orchestration, and complex workflow patterns to enable rapid development of intelligent applications.

## Introduction

AIGNE (AI Agent) Framework is designed to abstract away the complexities of working with multiple AI models and agent systems, allowing developers to focus on creating value through AI-powered features. The framework provides a unified interface for working with various AI models including OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, and Nova, while handling the orchestration, communication, and execution flow between different types of agents.

## Key Features

AIGNE Framework offers a rich set of features that enable developers to build sophisticated AI applications:

### Multiple AI Model Support

AIGNE provides built-in support for a variety of AI models, making it easy to integrate and switch between different AI providers:

```typescript
import { AIAgent, AIGNE } from "@aigne/core";
import { OpenAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/openai-chat-model.js";

// Create AI model instance
const model = new OpenAIChatModel({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  model: process.env.DEFAULT_CHAT_MODEL || "gpt-4-turbo",
});

// Create and configure AIGNE with the model
const aigne = new AIGNE({ model });
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize AIGNE with an OpenAI model. The framework's architecture allows for easy extension to support additional models by implementing the ChatModel interface.

### Powerful Agent System

The framework offers a rich hierarchy of agent types, each designed for specific purposes:

| Agent Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| AIAgent | AI-powered agents using various language models |
| TeamAgent | Orchestrates multiple agents in sequence or parallel |
| TransformAgent | Transforms data using JSONata expressions |
| MCPAgent | Integrates with Model Context Protocol services |
| GuideRailAgent | Validates and controls message flow |
| UserAgent | Manages user interactions and conversation state |

Here's a simple example of creating an AI agent:

```typescript
// Create AI agent
const agent = AIAgent.from({
  name: "Assistant",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
});

// Use the AIGNE to invoke the agent
const response = await aigne.invoke(agent, "Hello, can you help me write a short article?");
console.log(response);
```

### AIGNE Environment

The AIGNE environment provides a flexible context for agent communication and workflow execution:

```typescript
// Create a new AIGNE instance
const aigne = new AIGNE({ 
  name: "My AI Application",
  description: "An application that demonstrates AIGNE capabilities",
  model: openAIModel,
  agents: [assistantAgent, routerAgent, specialistAgent],
  skills: [calculatorSkill, weatherSkill, calendarSkill]
});

// Create a new context for isolated execution
const context = aigne.newContext();

// Invoke an agent with the specific context
const response = await context.invoke(assistantAgent, "What's the weather like today?");
```

The AIGNE environment manages the execution context, message passing between agents, and resource allocation to ensure optimal performance.

### Workflow Patterns

AIGNE Framework supports various workflow patterns for complex agent interactions:

```typescript
// Create a team agent for sequential execution
const sequentialTeam = TeamAgent.from({
  name: "SequentialTeam",
  agents: [preprocessAgent, mainProcessAgent, postprocessAgent],
  execution: "sequential" // Agents execute one after another
});

// Create a team agent for concurrent execution
const concurrentTeam = TeamAgent.from({
  name: "ConcurrentTeam",
  agents: [researchAgent, writingAgent, factCheckingAgent],
  execution: "concurrent" // Agents execute in parallel
});

// Create a router agent for conditional execution
const routerTeam = TeamAgent.from({
  name: "RouterTeam",
  agents: [
    routerAgent,
    {
      condition: "message.category === 'technical'",
      agent: technicalSupportAgent
    },
    {
      condition: "message.category === 'billing'",
      agent: billingAgent
    },
    {
      condition: "true", // Default fallback
      agent: generalSupportAgent
    }
  ],
  execution: "routing"
});
```

These patterns enable developers to create sophisticated agent interactions for complex tasks and workflows.

### Command-Line Tools

AIGNE CLI provides development and management tools for AIGNE applications:

```bash
# Create a new AIGNE project
aigne create my-project

# Run an agent
aigne run --path ./my-agents

# Run tests
aigne test --path ./my-agents

# Start MCP server
aigne serve-mcp --port 3001

# Start observability server
aigne observe
```

The CLI simplifies the development process, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment of AIGNE applications.

## Architecture

AIGNE Framework's architecture is built around the concept of agents, models, and an execution environment:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant AIGNE
    participant AIAgent
    participant Model
    participant Memory
    
    User->>AIGNE: invoke(agent, message)
    AIGNE->>AIGNE: Create context
    AIGNE->>AIAgent: invoke(message, context)
    AIAgent->>AIAgent: Pre-processing
    AIAgent->>Model: Generate response
    Model-->>AIAgent: Response
    AIAgent->>Memory: Store conversation
    AIAgent->>AIAgent: Post-processing
    AIAgent-->>AIGNE: Processed response
    AIGNE-->>User: Final response
```

The architecture enables flexible integration of different components while maintaining a consistent interface for developers.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example showing how to use AIGNE Framework to create a basic AI application:

```typescript
import { AIAgent, AIGNE } from "@aigne/core";
import { OpenAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/openai-chat-model.js";

// Initialize the AI model
const model = new OpenAIChatModel({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  model: "gpt-4-turbo",
});

// Create the agent
const agent = AIAgent.from({
  name: "Assistant",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant specialized in explaining complex topics simply.",
});

// Initialize AIGNE
const aigne = new AIGNE({ model });

// Function to interact with the agent
async function askQuestion(question) {
  const response = await aigne.invoke(agent, question);
  console.log(`Q: ${question}`);
  console.log(`A: ${response}`);
}

// Use the agent
askQuestion("Explain quantum computing in simple terms.");
```

This example demonstrates the core functionality of AIGNE Framework, showing how to create a model, define an agent, and invoke it with a question.

## Streaming Support

AIGNE Framework also supports streaming responses for real-time interaction:

```typescript
// Create a streaming response
const stream = await aigne.invoke(agent, "Write a short story about AI.", { streaming: true });

// Process the stream
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

Streaming enables developers to build more responsive applications that can provide feedback to users as the AI generates content.

## Summary

AIGNE Framework provides a powerful foundation for building AI-powered applications with a flexible architecture that supports multiple models, diverse agent types, and complex workflows. By abstracting away the complexities of AI integration and agent orchestration, the framework enables developers to focus on creating value through intelligent features.
