# Guides

This section provides practical, step-by-step tutorials to help you accomplish common development tasks with `@aigne/cli`. These guides are designed to give you hands-on experience with key workflows, from creating your first agent to deploying it for production use.

We recommend having a basic understanding of the topics covered in the [Core Concepts](./core-concepts.md) section before diving in.

### [Creating a Custom Agent](./guides-creating-a-custom-agent.md)

Learn how to build a custom agent from scratch. This guide covers scaffolding a new project using `aigne create`, defining agent logic in JavaScript, and integrating it as a skill within your `aigne.yaml` configuration.

### [Running Remote Agents](./guides-running-remote-agents.md)

Discover how to execute AIGNE projects directly from a remote URL, such as a Git repository or a tarball. This guide covers the `aigne run --url` command and is useful for testing, sharing, and running agents without a local setup.

### [Deploying Agents](./guides-deploying-agents.md)

Take your AIGNE application from development to production. This guide walks you through the process of deploying your project as a Blocklet to a specified endpoint using the `aigne deploy` command, making your agent accessible as a service.
