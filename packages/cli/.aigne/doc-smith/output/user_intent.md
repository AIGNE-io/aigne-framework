# User Intent for @aigne/cli Documentation

## 1. Target Audience
- **Agent Developers**: Developers using the AIGNE Framework to build, test, and deploy AI agents. They need to know how to use the CLI to facilitate their workflow.
- **AIGNE Framework Users**: General users looking to explore or run existing AIGNE agents.
- **CLI Contributors**: Developers who want to contribute to the `@aigne/cli` codebase itself, understanding its internal structure and testing mechanisms.

## 2. Primary Use Cases
- **Project Initialization**: Creating new AIGNE projects from templates (`aigne create`).
- **Development Loop**: Running agents locally for testing and debugging (`aigne run`).
- **Testing**: Executing unit and integration tests for agents (`aigne test`).
- **Integration**: Serving agents as MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers (`aigne serve-mcp`).
- **Observability**: Monitoring agent activities (`aigne observe`).
- **Tool Maintenance**: Understanding how to build, test, and extend the CLI itself.

## 3. Documentation Focus
- **User Guide**: Step-by-step instructions on how to install and use the CLI for daily tasks.
- **Command Reference**: Detailed documentation of all commands, flags, and arguments (e.g., `run`, `create`, `test`).
- **Developer Guide**: Information for contributors on how to build, test, and understand the CLI architecture (given the presence of `src/` and `test/` in the workspace).
