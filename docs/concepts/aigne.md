# AIGNE Framework: Orchestrating Intelligent Agent Interactions

The AIGNE framework provides a robust environment for managing complex AI applications by coordinating multiple intelligent agents. It enables developers to integrate various agents with custom models and configurations, allowing for the seamless orchestration of tasks. This framework is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring the dynamic interaction of specialized agents, such as in modular AI systems or distributed AI environments.

## Initializing AIGNE with Custom Models and Adding Agents

The AIGNE framework serves as a central coordination point for AI applications, allowing developers to orchestrate interactions between multiple agents. Users can initialize an AIGNE instance with specific configurations, including a global model like OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini. This setup allows for the integration of various agents that can utilize the defined model to perform AI-driven tasks. By providing a description and utilizing the `addAgent` method, users can augment the instance's capabilities and tailor it to specific needs.

```ts file="/Users/chao/Projects/blocklet/aigne-framework/docs-examples/test/concepts/aigne.test.ts" region="example-aigne-basic-create-aigne"
const aigne = new AIGNE({
  model: new OpenAIChatModel({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  }),
});
assert(aigne.model);

const agent = AIAgent.from({
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant",
});

aigne.addAgent(agent);
```

## Invoking Agents for AI-Powered Responses

The `invoke` method in the AIGNE class provides a robust mechanism for interacting with agents using straightforward message inputs. Whether querying a single response or processing streaming outputs, this method facilitates the delivery of actionable insights from the agents. Developers can leverage this method for synchronous or asynchronous communication patterns, ensuring flexible integration within various AI application workflows.

```ts file="/Users/chao/Projects/blocklet/aigne-framework/docs-examples/test/concepts/aigne.test.ts" region="example-aigne-basic-invoke-agent"
spyOn(aigne.model, "process").mockReturnValueOnce({
  text: "AIGNE is a platform for building AI agents.",
});
const result = await aigne.invoke(agent, "What is AIGNE?");
console.log(result);
// Output: { $message: "AIGNE is a platform for building AI agents." }
expect(result).toEqual({ $message: "AIGNE is a platform for building AI agents." });
```

## Streaming Agent Responses for Real-time Processing

AIGNE's ability to handle streaming responses allows applications to process data in real-time, which is essential for tasks like conversational AI where prompt feedback enhances user experience. Utilizing the streaming feature ensures that the application can react dynamically to parts of the data as they are produced, enabling more interactive and responsive system behaviors.

```ts file="/Users/chao/Projects/blocklet/aigne-framework/docs-examples/test/concepts/aigne.test.ts" region="example-aigne-basic-invoke-agent-streaming"
spyOn(aigne.model, "process").mockReturnValueOnce(
  stringToAgentResponseStream("AIGNE is a platform for building AI agents."),
);
const stream = await aigne.invoke(agent, "What is AIGNE?", { streaming: true });
let response = "";
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  if (isAgentResponseDelta(chunk)) {
    if (chunk.delta.text?.$message) response += chunk.delta.text.$message;
  }
}
console.log(response);
// Output:  "AIGNE is a platform for building AI agents."
expect(response).toEqual("AIGNE is a platform for building AI agents.");
```

## Creating and Using User Agents for Consistent Interactions

The concept of a User Agent in the AIGNE framework simplifies recurrent interactions with specific agents by wrapping an existing agent, promoting code reusability and streamlined interactions. This feature is essential for scenarios where an agent must be repeatedly called with possibly varying inputs, providing a consistent interface and encapsulating interactions efficiently.

```ts file="/Users/chao/Projects/blocklet/aigne-framework/docs-examples/test/concepts/aigne.test.ts" region="example-aigne-basic-invoke-agent-user-agent"
spyOn(aigne.model, "process").mockReturnValueOnce({
  text: "AIGNE is a platform for building AI agents.",
});
const userAgent = aigne.invoke(agent);
const result1 = await userAgent.invoke("What is AIGNE?");
console.log(result1);
// Output: { $message: "AIGNE is a platform for building AI agents." }
expect(result1).toEqual({ $message: "AIGNE is a platform for building AI agents." });
```

## Shutting Down AIGNE Instances Safely

The shutdown method is a vital part of the lifecycle management in AIGNE, ensuring that all agents and resources are properly closed out. This functionality is crucial for cleaning up resources in a structured and predictable manner, preventing resource leaks and ensuring stability, especially in long-running or frequently initializing and terminating applications.

```ts file="/Users/chao/Projects/blocklet/aigne-framework/docs-examples/test/concepts/aigne.test.ts" region="example-aigne-basic-shutdown"
await aigne.shutdown();
```

## Loading Pre-configured AIGNE Instances from Files

The static `load` method offers a streamlined approach to initialize a complex AIGNE setup from configurations defined in external files, such as YAML. This design promotes modularity and ease of configuration management, allowing teams to define agent strategies and settings separately from the codebase, thus enhancing maintainability and scalability.

```ts file="/Users/chao/Projects/blocklet/aigne-framework/docs-examples/test/concepts/aigne.test.ts" region="example-aigne-load"
const path = join(import.meta.dirname, "../../test-aigne"); // "/PATH/TO/AIGNE_PROJECT";

const aigne = await AIGNE.load(path, { models: [OpenAIChatModel] });

assert(aigne.model);
expect(aigne.model).toBeInstanceOf(OpenAIChatModel);
```

In summary, the AIGNE framework equips developers with comprehensive tools for building sophisticated AI systems through efficient agent orchestration and model management. Throughout the document, methods like `invoke`, `publish`, and `subscribe` offer varied communication patterns, while utilities such as `addAgent` and `load` further enhance the frameworkâ€™s adaptability to different application contexts. To optimize its application, developers are encouraged to consider the integration and lifecycle strategies discussed, ensuring robust and efficient AI workflows.
