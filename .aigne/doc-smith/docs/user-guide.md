# User Guide

Welcome to the AIGNE User Guide. This guide is designed to provide a clear, non-technical overview of the AIGNE framework. If you're curious about what AIGNE is and how it uses concepts like "Agents" and "Workflows" to build powerful AI applications, you're in the right place.

Our focus here is on the core ideas—the 'what' and the 'why'—rather than the technical 'how'. We'll explain the purpose of the framework and its main components in plain language, helping you build a solid conceptual foundation.
