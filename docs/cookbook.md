## Introduction

AIGNE Framework is a framework for building applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a series of tools and abstractions that enable developers to easily create complex AI workflows. This Cookbook aims to help developers understand the core concepts of AIGNE Framework and demonstrate through examples how to use different workflow patterns to solve real-world problems.

## Installation

To get started with AIGNE Framework, you need to install the relevant dependencies.

### Installing AIGNE Framework

**npm**

```bash
npm install @aigne/core

# If you need advanced Agents from Agent Library
npm install @aigne/agent-library

# Install LLM libraries as needed
npm install openai @anthropic-ai/sdk @google/generative-ai
```

**yarn**

```bash
yarn add @aigne/core

# If you need advanced Agents from Agent Library
yarn add @aigne/agent-library

# Install LLM libraries as needed
yarn add openai @anthropic-ai/sdk @google/generative-ai
```

**pnpm**

```bash
pnpm install @aigne/core

# If you need advanced Agents from Agent Library
pnpm install @aigne/agent-library

# Install LLM libraries as needed
pnpm install openai @anthropic-ai/sdk @google/generative-ai
```

### Using @aigne/core in CommonJS Environment

@aigne/core supports use in both CommonJS and ES Module environments. If your project uses the CommonJS module system, but due to a [third-party lib not supporting ESM](https://github.com/AIGNE-io/aigne-framework/issues/36), you need to add the following configuration to your project's package.json before the issue is fixed:

**npm**

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "pkce-challenge": "https://github.com/AIGNE-io/pkce-challenge#dist"
  }
}
```

**yarn or pnpm**

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "pkce-challenge": "https://github.com/AIGNE-io/pkce-challenge#dist"
  }
}
```

## Core Concepts

### Chat Model

In AIGNE Framework, ChatModel is an abstract base class for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a unified interface to handle different underlying model implementations, including:

- **OpenAIChatModel**: For communicating with OpenAI's GPT series models
- **ClaudeChatModel**: For communicating with Anthropic's Claude series models
- **XAIChatModel**: For communicating with X.AI's Grok series models

ChatModel can be used directly, but it's generally recommended to use it through AIGNE to gain more advanced features like tool integration, error handling, and state management.

**Example**:

```typescript
import { OpenAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/openai-chat-model.js";
import { ClaudeChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/claude-chat-model.js";
import { XAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/xai-chat-model.js";

// Initialize OpenAI model
const openaiModel = new OpenAIChatModel({
  apiKey: "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
  model: "gpt-4o-mini", // Optional, defaults to "gpt-4o-mini"
});

// Initialize Claude model
const claudeModel = new ClaudeChatModel({
  apiKey: "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
  model: "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest", // Optional, defaults to "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"
});

// Initialize X.AI Grok model
const xaiModel = new XAIChatModel({
  apiKey: "YOUR_XAI_API_KEY",
  model: "grok-2-latest", // Optional, defaults to "grok-2-latest"
});

// Use with AIGNE
const aigne = new AIGNE({ model: openaiModel });
```

For more information, refer to the [ChatModel API documentation](./apis/chat-model.md).

### Agent

In AIGNE Framework, Agents are the basic building blocks of workflows. Each Agent has specific instructions and capabilities to process inputs and produce outputs. The framework provides several types of Agents:

- **AIAgent**: Agents using large language models, capable of understanding and generating natural language
- **FunctionAgent**: Agents that execute specific functions, typically used to interact with external systems
- **MCPAgent**: Agents that connect to Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, providing additional capabilities

### Workflow

AIGNE Framework supports multiple workflow patterns, each suitable for different scenarios:

- **Sequential Workflow**: Agents execute in sequence
- **Concurrency Workflow**: Multiple Agents execute in parallel
- **Reflection Workflow**: Agents improve outputs through feedback loops
- **Handoff Workflow**: Agents transfer tasks between each other
- **Router Workflow**: Dynamically select Agents based on input
- **Orchestrator Workflow**: Organize multiple Agents to work together

### AIGNE

The AIGNE is the runtime environment for workflows, responsible for coordinating communication and execution flow between Agents.

```typescript
const aigne = new AIGNE({ model });
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Code Execution Workflow

**Scenario**: Need to dynamically execute code to solve problems, such as calculations or algorithm implementations

**Workflow Process**:
1. User provides a problem
2. Coder Agent generates code
3. Sandbox Agent executes the code
4. Coder returns the result

**Example**:

```typescript
import { AIAgent, AIGNE, FunctionAgent } from "@aigne/core";
import { OpenAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/openai-chat-model.js";
import { z } from "zod";

// Create JavaScript sandbox
const sandbox = FunctionAgent.from({
  name: "js-sandbox",
  description: "A js sandbox for running javascript code",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    code: z.string().describe("The code to run"),
  }),
  fn: async (input: { code: string }) => {
    const { code } = input;
    const result = eval(code);
    return { result };
  },
});

// Create coder Agent
const coder = AIAgent.from({
  name: "coder",
  instructions: `\
You are a proficient coder. You write code to solve problems.
Work with the sandbox to execute your code.
`,
  skills: [sandbox],
});

// Create AIGNE and run
const aigne = new AIGNE({ model });
const result = await aigne.invoke(coder, "10! = ?");
console.log(result);
// Output: { text: "The value of \\(10!\\) (10 factorial) is 3,628,800." }
```

### Sequential Workflow

**Scenario**: Need to process data through multiple steps in sequence, such as content generation pipeline

**Workflow Process**:
1. Execute multiple Agents in sequence
2. Each Agent's output serves as input for the next Agent
3. The final output is the result of the last Agent

**Example**:

```typescript
import { AIAgent, AIGNE } from "@aigne/core";
import { OpenAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/openai-chat-model.js";

// Concept extractor Agent
const conceptExtractor = AIAgent.from({
  instructions: `\
You are a marketing analyst. Give a product description, identity:
- Key features
- Target audience
- Unique selling points

Product description:
{{product}}`,
  outputKey: "concept",
});

// Copywriter Agent
const writer = AIAgent.from({
  instructions: `\
You are a marketing copywriter. Given a block of text describing features, audience, and USPs,
compose a compelling marketing copy (like a newsletter section) that highlights these points.
Output should be short (around 150 words), output just the copy as a single text block.

Product description:
{{product}}

Below is the info about the product:
{{concept}}`,
  outputKey: "draft",
});

// Proofreading Agent
const formatProof = AIAgent.from({
  instructions: `\
You are an editor. Given the draft copy, correct grammar, improve clarity, ensure consistent tone,
give format and make it polished. Output the final improved copy as a single text block.

Product description:
{{product}}

Below is the info about the product:
{{concept}}

Draft copy:
{{draft}}`,
  outputKey: "content",
});

// Execute three Agents in sequence
const aigne = new AIGNE({ model });
const result = await aigne.invoke(sequential(conceptExtractor, writer, formatProof),
  { product: "AIGNE is a No-code Generative AI Apps Engine" }
);

console.log(result);
// Output contains results from concept, draft, and content stages
```

### Concurrency Workflow

**Scenario**: Need to execute multiple independent tasks in parallel and then aggregate results

**Workflow Process**:
1. Execute multiple Agents simultaneously
2. Collect results from all Agents
3. Return an object containing all results

**Example**:

```typescript
import { AIAgent, AIGNE, parallel } from "@aigne/core";
import { OpenAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/openai-chat-model.js";

// Feature extraction Agent
const featureExtractor = AIAgent.from({
  instructions: `\
You are a product analyst. Extract and summarize the key features of the product.

Product description:
{{product}}`,
  outputKey: "features",
});

// Audience analysis Agent
const audienceAnalyzer = AIAgent.from({
  instructions: `\
You are a market researcher. Identify the target audience for the product.

Product description:
{{product}}`,
  outputKey: "audience",
});

// Execute two Agents in parallel
const aigne = new AIGNE({ model });
const result = await aigne.invoke(
  parallel(featureExtractor, audienceAnalyzer),
  { product: "AIGNE is a No-code Generative AI Apps Engine" }
);

console.log(result);
// Output simultaneously contains both features and audience results
```

### Reflection Workflow

**Scenario**: Need to improve output through multiple iterations, such as code review and fixes

**Workflow Process**:
1. Initial Agent generates a solution
2. Review Agent evaluates the solution
3. If review fails, return to initial Agent for improvements
4. If review passes, return the final result

**Example**:

```typescript
import {
  AIAgent,
  AIGNE,
  UserInputTopic,
  UserOutputTopic,
} from "@aigne/core";
import { OpenAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/openai-chat-model.js";
import { z } from "zod";

// Coder Agent
const coder = AIAgent.from({
  subscribeTopic: [UserInputTopic, "rewrite_request"],
  publishTopic: "review_request",
  instructions: `\
You are a proficient coder. You write code to solve problems.
Work with the reviewer to improve your code.
Always put all finished code in a single Markdown code block.

Respond using the following format:

Thoughts: <Your comments>
Code: <Your code>

Previous review result:
{{feedback}}

User's question:
{{question}}
`,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    code: z.string().describe("Your code"),
  }),
});

// Reviewer Agent
const reviewer = AIAgent.from({
  subscribeTopic: "review_request",
  publishTopic: (output) => (output.approval ? UserOutputTopic : "rewrite_request"),
  instructions: `\
You are a code reviewer. You focus on correctness, efficiency and safety of the code.

The problem statement is: {{question}}
The code is:
\`\`\`
{{code}}
\`\`\`

Previous feedback:
{{feedback}}

Please review the code. If previous feedback was provided, see if it was addressed.
`,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    approval: z.boolean().describe("APPROVE or REVISE"),
    feedback: z.object({
      correctness: z.string().describe("Your comments on correctness"),
      efficiency: z.string().describe("Your comments on efficiency"),
      safety: z.string().describe("Your comments on safety"),
      suggested_changes: z.string().describe("Your comments on suggested changes"),
    }),
  }),
  includeInputInOutput: true,
});

// Execute reflection workflow
const aigne = new AIGNE({ model, agents: [coder, reviewer] });
const result = await aigne.invoke("Write a function to find the sum of all even numbers in a list.");
console.log(result);
// Output contains approved code and feedback
```

### Handoff Workflow

**Scenario**: Need to switch between different Agents based on interaction state, such as transferring customer service

**Workflow Process**:
1. Initial Agent handles user request
2. If transfer is needed, initial Agent passes control to another Agent
3. New Agent takes over the conversation and continues processing

**Example**:

```typescript
import { AIAgent, AIGNE } from "@aigne/core";
import { OpenAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/openai-chat-model.js";

// Function to transfer to Agent B
function transfer_to_b() {
  return agentB;
}

// Agent A
const agentA = AIAgent.from({
  name: "AgentA",
  instructions: "You are a helpful agent.",
  outputKey: "A",
  skills: [transfer_to_b],
});

// Agent B
const agentB = AIAgent.from({
  name: "AgentB",
  instructions: "Only speak in Haikus.",
  outputKey: "B",
});

// Execute handoff workflow
const aigne = new AIGNE({ model });
const userAgent = aigne.invoke(agentA);

// Transfer to Agent B
const result1 = await userAgent.invoke("transfer to agent b");
console.log(result1);
// { B: "Transfer now complete,  \nAgent B is here to help.  \nWhat do you need, friend?" }

// Continue interacting with Agent B
const result2 = await userAgent.invoke("It's a beautiful day");
console.log(result2);
// { B: "Sunshine warms the earth,  \nGentle breeze whispers softly,  \nNature sings with joy." }
```

### Router Workflow

**Scenario**: Need to automatically select appropriate handling Agent based on user input, such as customer service routing

**Workflow Process**:
1. Router Agent analyzes user request
2. Automatically selects the most suitable handling Agent
3. Selected Agent processes the request and returns result

**Example**:

```typescript
import { AIAgent, AIGNE } from "@aigne/core";
import { OpenAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/openai-chat-model.js";

// Product support Agent
const productSupport = AIAgent.from({
  enableHistory: true,
  name: "product_support",
  description: "Agent to assist with any product-related questions.",
  instructions: `You are an agent capable of handling any product-related questions.
  Your goal is to provide accurate and helpful information about the product.
  Be polite, professional, and ensure the user feels supported.`,
  outputKey: "product_support",
});

// Feedback Agent
const feedback = AIAgent.from({
  enableHistory: true,
  name: "feedback",
  description: "Agent to assist with any feedback-related questions.",
  instructions: `You are an agent capable of handling any feedback-related questions.
  Your goal is to listen to the user's feedback, acknowledge their input, and provide appropriate responses.
  Be empathetic, understanding, and ensure the user feels heard.`,
  outputKey: "feedback",
});

// General query Agent
const other = AIAgent.from({
  enableHistory: true,
  name: "other",
  description: "Agent to assist with any general questions.",
  instructions: `You are an agent capable of handling any general questions.
  Your goal is to provide accurate and helpful information on a wide range of topics.
  Be friendly, knowledgeable, and ensure the user feels satisfied with the information provided.`,
  outputKey: "other",
});

// Triage Agent
const triage = AIAgent.from({
  name: "triage",
  instructions: `You are an agent capable of routing questions to the appropriate agent.
  Your goal is to understand the user's query and direct them to the agent best suited to assist them.
  Be efficient, clear, and ensure the user is connected to the right resource quickly.`,
  skills: [productSupport, feedback, other],
  toolChoice: "router", // Set to router mode
});

// Execute router workflow
const aigne = new AIGNE({ model });

// Product-related questions automatically routed to product support
const result1 = await aigne.invoke(triage, "How to use this product?");
console.log(result1);
// { product_support: "I'd be happy to help you with that! However, I need to know which specific product you're referring to..." }

// Feedback-related questions automatically routed to feedback
const result2 = await aigne.invoke(triage, "I have feedback about the app.");
console.log(result2);
// { feedback: "Thank you for sharing your feedback! I'm here to listen..." }

// General questions automatically routed to general query
const result3 = await aigne.invoke(triage, "What is the weather today?");
console.log(result3);
// { other: "I can't provide real-time weather updates. However, you can check a reliable weather website..." }
```

### Orchestrator Workflow

**Scenario**: Need to coordinate multiple specialized Agents to complete complex tasks, such as research report generation

**Workflow Process**:
1. Orchestrator Agent analyzes task and determines required subtasks
2. Calls specialized Agents to execute each subtask
3. Synthesizes all results into final output

**Example**:

```typescript
import { OrchestratorAgent } from "@aigne/agent-library";
import { AIAgent, AIGNE, MCPAgent } from "@aigne/core";
import { OpenAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/openai-chat-model.js";

// Create specialized Agents
const puppeteer = await MCPAgent.from({
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"],
});

const finder = AIAgent.from({
  name: "finder",
  description: "Find the closest match to a user's request",
  instructions: `You are an agent with access to the filesystem,
  as well as the ability to fetch URLs. Your job is to identify
  the closest match to a user's request, make the appropriate tool calls,
  and return the URI and CONTENTS of the closest match.

  Rules:
  - use document.body.innerText to get the text content of a page
  - if you want a url to some page, you should get all link and it's title of current(home) page,
  then you can use the title to search the url of the page you want to visit.
  `,
  skills: [puppeteer],
});

const enhancedFinder = OrchestratorAgent.from({
  name: "enhanced_finder",
  description: "Enhanced finder with more skills",
  skills: [finder],
});

const filesystem = await MCPAgent.from({
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", import.meta.dir],
});

const writer = AIAgent.from({
  name: "writer",
  description: "Write to the filesystem",
  instructions: `You are an agent that can write to the filesystem.
  You are tasked with taking the user's input, addressing it, and
  writing the result to disk in the appropriate location.`,
  skills: [filesystem],
});

// Various review Agents
const proofreader = AIAgent.from({
  name: "proofreader",
  description: "Review the short story for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors",
  instructions: `Review the short story for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.
  Identify any awkward phrasing or structural issues that could improve clarity.
  Provide detailed feedback on corrections.`,
  skills: [],
});

const fact_checker = AIAgent.from({
  name: "fact_checker",
  description: "Verify the factual consistency within the story",
  instructions: `Verify the factual consistency within the story. Identify any contradictions,
  logical inconsistencies, or inaccuracies in the plot, character actions, or setting.
  Highlight potential issues with reasoning or coherence.`,
  skills: [],
});

const style_enforcer = AIAgent.from({
  name: "style_enforcer",
  description: "Analyze the story for adherence to style guidelines",
  instructions: `Analyze the story for adherence to style guidelines.
  Evaluate the narrative flow, clarity of expression, and tone. Suggest improvements to
  enhance storytelling, readability, and engagement.`,
  skills: [],
});

// Create orchestrator Agent
const agent = OrchestratorAgent.from({
  skills: [enhancedFinder, writer, proofreader, fact_checker, style_enforcer],
});

// Execute orchestrator workflow
const aigne = new AIGNE({ model });
const result = await aigne.invoke(
  agent,
  `Conduct an in-depth research on ArcBlock using only the official website\
(avoid search engines or third-party sources) and compile a detailed report saved as arcblock.md. \
The report should include comprehensive insights into the company's products \
(with detailed research findings and links), technical architecture, and future plans.`
);
console.log(result);
```

## MCP Server Integration

AIGNE Framework can integrate with external servers through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to extend its functionality.

### Puppeteer MCP Server

The Puppeteer MCP server allows AIGNE Framework to access and manipulate web content.

**Features**:
- Navigate to URLs
- Execute JavaScript
- Extract web content

**Example**:

```typescript
import {
  AIAgent,
  AIGNE,
  MCPAgent,
} from "@aigne/core";
import { OpenAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/openai-chat-model.js";

// Create Puppeteer MCP Agent
const puppeteerMCPAgent = await MCPAgent.from({
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"],
});

// Create AIGNE
const aigne = new AIGNE({
  model,
  skills: [puppeteerMCPAgent],
});

// Create Agent using Puppeteer
const agent = AIAgent.from({
  instructions: `\
## Steps to extract content from a website
1. navigate to the url
2. evaluate document.body.innerText to get the content
`,
});

// Execute content extraction
const result = await aigne.invoke(
  agent,
  "extract content from https://www.arcblock.io"
);

console.log(result);
// Output extracted web content

await aigne.shutdown();
```

### SQLite MCP Server

The SQLite MCP server allows AIGNE Framework to interact with SQLite databases.

**Features**:
- Execute read queries
- Execute write queries
- Create tables
- List tables
- Describe table structure

**Example**:

```typescript
import { join } from "node:path";
import {
  AIAgent,
  AIGNE,
  MCPAgent,
} from "@aigne/core";
import { OpenAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/openai-chat-model.js";

// Create SQLite MCP Agent
const sqlite = await MCPAgent.from({
  command: "uvx",
  args: [
    "-q",
    "mcp-server-sqlite",
    "--db-path",
    join(process.cwd(), "usages.db"),
  ],
});

// Create AIGNE
const aigne = new AIGNE({
  model,
  skills: [sqlite],
});

// Create database admin Agent
const agent = AIAgent.from({
  instructions: "You are a database administrator",
});

// Create table
console.log(
  await aigne.invoke(
    agent,
    "create a product table with columns name description and createdAt"
  )
);

// Insert data
console.log(await aigne.invoke(agent, "create 10 products for test"));

// Query data
console.log(await aigne.invoke(agent, "how many products?"));
// Output: { text: "There are 10 products in the database." }

await aigne.shutdown();
```

## Usage Patterns and Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Workflow Pattern

Consider the following factors when choosing a workflow pattern:

1. **Task Complexity**: Simple tasks can use a single Agent, complex tasks should use multi-Agent workflows
2. **Interaction Requirements**: Tasks requiring user participation are suitable for reflection or handoff workflows
3. **Parallelism**: Subtasks that can be executed independently are suitable for concurrency workflows
4. **Process Control**: Tasks that need to strictly follow steps are suitable for sequential workflows
5. **Decision Branches**: Tasks that need to dynamically select processing paths based on input are suitable for router workflows
6. **Complex Coordination**: Tasks requiring multiple specialized Agents to work together are suitable for orchestrator workflows

### Designing Effective Agent Prompts

Best practices when writing Agent instructions:

1. **Clear Role**: Clearly define the Agent's identity and responsibilities
2. **Specific Instructions**: Provide clear steps and guidance
3. **Output Format**: Specify expected output format, especially when using Schema
4. **Context Variables**: Use double curly braces `{{variable}}` to reference context variables
5. **Chain of Thought**: Encourage Agents to show their reasoning process
6. **Scope Limitations**: Clearly define what the Agent can and cannot do

### Combining Multiple Workflow Patterns

Complex applications may require combining multiple workflow patterns:

1. **Sequential + Concurrency**: Some steps execute sequentially, with one step internally executing multiple tasks concurrently
2. **Reflection + Sequential**: Sequential workflow output is improved through reflection workflow
3. **Router + Specialized Agents**: Use router to select appropriate specialized Agent to handle requests
4. **Orchestrator + All Others**: Orchestrator workflow can coordinate using Agents with all other workflow patterns

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **How to share data between different Agents?**
   - Use `outputKey` to map an Agent's output to a specific key in the context
   - The next Agent can access this data via `{{key}}`

2. **How to handle Agent failures or errors?**
   - Use try/catch to wrap aigne.invoke calls
   - Consider possible failure paths when designing workflows, add error handling Agents

3. **How to constrain Agent output format?**
   - Use `outputSchema` to define expected output structure
   - Use Zod schema for validation and type checking

4. **How to customize communication paths between Agents?**
   - Use `subscribeTopic` and `publishTopic` to define message topics
   - Create custom topic routing logic

5. **How to integrate external systems and APIs?**
   - Use MCPAgent to connect to appropriate MCP servers
   - Create custom FunctionAgent to encapsulate API calls
