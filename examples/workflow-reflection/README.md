## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and npm installed on your machine
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) used to interact with OpenAI API
- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io) [Optional] if you want to run the example from source code

## Try without Installation

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY # setup your OpenAI API key

npx -y @aigne/example-workflow-reflection # run the example
```

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIGNE-io/aigne-framework
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd aigne-framework/examples/workflow-reflection

pnpm install
```

### Setup Environment Variables

Setup your OpenAI API key in the `.env.local` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="" # setup your OpenAI API key here
```

### Run the Example

```bash
pnpm start
```

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to build a reflection workflow:

```typescript
import assert from "node:assert";
import {
  AIAgent,
  OpenAIChatModel,
  ExecutionEngine,
  UserInputTopic,
  UserOutputTopic,
} from "@aigne/core";
import { z } from "zod";

const { OPENAI_API_KEY } = process.env;
assert(OPENAI_API_KEY, "Please set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable");

const model = new OpenAIChatModel({
  apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const coder = AIAgent.from({
  subscribeTopic: [UserInputTopic, "rewrite_request"],
  publishTopic: "review_request",
  instructions: `\
You are a proficient coder. You write code to solve problems.
Work with the reviewer to improve your code.
Always put all finished code in a single Markdown code block.
For example:
\`\`\`python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
\`\`\`

Respond using the following format:

Thoughts: <Your comments>
Code: <Your code>

Previous review result:
{{feedback}}

User's question:
{{question}}
`,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    code: z.string().describe("Your code"),
  }),
});

const reviewer = AIAgent.from({
  subscribeTopic: "review_request",
  publishTopic: (output) => (output.approval ? UserOutputTopic : "rewrite_request"),
  instructions: `\
You are a code reviewer. You focus on correctness, efficiency and safety of the code.

The problem statement is: {{question}}
The code is:
\`\`\`
{{code}}
\`\`\`

Previous feedback:
{{feedback}}

Please review the code. If previous feedback was provided, see if it was addressed.
`,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    approval: z.boolean().describe("APPROVE or REVISE"),
    feedback: z.object({
      correctness: z.string().describe("Your comments on correctness"),
      efficiency: z.string().describe("Your comments on efficiency"),
      safety: z.string().describe("Your comments on safety"),
      suggested_changes: z.string().describe("Your comments on suggested changes"),
    }),
  }),
  includeInputInOutput: true,
});

const engine = new ExecutionEngine({ model, agents: [coder, reviewer] });
engine.publish(UserInputTopic, "Write a function to find the sum of all even numbers in a list.");

const { message } = await engine.subscribe(UserOutputTopic);
console.log(message);
// Output:
// {
//   code: "def sum_of_even_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Function to calculate the sum of all even numbers in a list.\"\"\"\n    return sum(number for number in numbers if number % 2 == 0)",
//   approval: true,
//   feedback: {
//     correctness: "The function correctly calculates the sum of all even numbers in the given list. It properly checks for evenness using the modulus operator and sums the valid numbers.",
//     efficiency: "The implementation is efficient as it uses a generator expression which computes the sum in a single pass over the list. This minimizes memory usage as compared to creating an intermediate list of even numbers.",
//     safety: "The function does not contain any safety issues. However, it assumes that all elements in the input list are integers. It would be prudent to handle cases where the input contains non-integer values (e.g., None, strings, etc.).",
//     suggested_changes: "Consider adding type annotations to the function for better clarity and potential type checking, e.g. `def sum_of_even_numbers(numbers: list[int]) -> int:`. Also, include input validation to ensure 'numbers' is a list of integers.",
//   },
// }
