# Guides

This section provides practical, step-by-step tutorials to help you accomplish common development tasks with `@aigne/cli`. These guides are designed to walk you through real-world scenarios, building on the concepts introduced in the earlier sections.

Whether you're creating your first custom agent or running projects from a remote source, these guides offer clear instructions and code examples to get you started.

### [Creating a Custom Agent](./guides-creating-a-custom-agent.md)

Learn how to build a new agent from the ground up. This guide covers the entire process, from scaffolding the initial files to writing the core logic for your agent in JavaScript or TypeScript and integrating it as a reusable skill within your AIGNE project.

### [Running Remote Agents](./guides-running-remote-agents.md)

Discover how to execute AIGNE agents directly from a remote source, such as a Git repository or a tarball URL. This guide explains how the `aigne run` command can download, cache, and run projects without needing a local checkout, streamlining testing and deployment.
