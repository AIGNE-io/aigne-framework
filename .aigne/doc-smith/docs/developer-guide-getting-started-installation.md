# Installation

To begin building with the AIGNE Framework, you first need to install the `@aigne/core` package. This package contains all the essential modules for creating and managing AI agents and workflows.

This guide provides installation instructions for the most common Node.js package managers: npm, Yarn, and pnpm.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have a recent version of Node.js installed in your development environment.

### Using npm

Execute the following command in your project's terminal to install the package using npm.

```bash npm icon=logos:npm-icon
npm install @aigne/core
```

### Using Yarn

If you are using Yarn as your package manager, use the command below.

```bash yarn icon=logos:yarn
yarn add @aigne/core
```

### Using pnpm

For projects managed with pnpm, run the following command.

```bash pnpm icon=pnpm
pnpm add @aigne/core
```

With the installation complete, you are now ready to build your first agent. Proceed to the next section for a step-by-step guide.
