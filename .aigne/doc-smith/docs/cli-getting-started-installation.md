# Installation

Getting the AIGNE Command Line Tool (CLI) set up on your computer is the first step on your journey to building powerful AI agents. This guide will walk you through the simple installation process.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. The AIGNE CLI is a Node.js application, and you'll need it to run the installation commands. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Install the CLI

You can install the AIGNE CLI globally on your system using your preferred package manager: npm, Yarn, or pnpm. Open your terminal or command prompt and run one of the following commands.

```bash npm
npm install -g @aigne/cli
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add @aigne/cli
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g @aigne/cli
```

### Verify Your Installation

Once the installation is complete, you can verify that it was successful by checking the version or viewing the help menu. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
aigne --help
```

If the CLI is installed correctly, you will see a list of available commands and options. This confirms that you are ready to start creating and managing your AI agents.

### Next Steps

Congratulations, you've successfully installed the AIGNE CLI! Now you're ready for the fun part. Let's move on to creating your first project.
