# Guides

This section provides practical, step-by-step guides for accomplishing common development tasks with the AIGNE CLI. While the [Command Reference](./command-reference.md) offers a detailed look at every command and option, these guides focus on achieving specific goals from start to finish.

Each guide is designed to walk you through a real-world scenario, providing code snippets and clear instructions to help you use key features of the AIGNE framework effectively. The image below shows an agent running in an interactive chat session, a common result of following these guides.

### [Running Remote Agents](./guides-running-remote-agents.md)

Learn how to run agents directly from a remote Git repository or tarball URL. This guide covers how the `aigne run` command downloads, caches, and executes remote projects, a useful feature for testing, sharing, and collaboration without needing a local setup.
